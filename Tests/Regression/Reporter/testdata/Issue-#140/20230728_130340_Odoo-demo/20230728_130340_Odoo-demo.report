note = Define your template by adding sections and configuring the section settingsx12Each section can be:x12 -  Note (like this) section, free textx12 -  Heading, usefull for grouping sectionsx12 -  Contents like a table of contents or figuresx12 -  Data Table, with data from test resultsx12 -  Data Graph, for graphical representation of test resultsx12 -  Errors, gather error details and screenshots (if applicable) from robot logsx12x12Each section can also have sub sections.x12x12Use the arrows buttons to move sections up and down within the report.x12x12The cover page and overall report settings can be found on the settings pane of the Report item above.x12x12When you have your report how you like it, save it as a report template, so your future test results can use the same report format.x12x12
